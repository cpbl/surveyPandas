# surveypandas
Tools for managing (survey) datasets in which variables have descriptions and their possible values may each have a description (label) as well. Data are in a Pandas DataFrame, and the labels are in a nested dict. Routines for reading in, writing out to Stata (other commercial formats?); managing missing value categories; etc.
